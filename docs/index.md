# Mad-Pascal

**Mad-Pascal** (MP) is a 32-bit **Turbo Pascal** compiler for **Atari XE/XL**. By design, it is compatible with the **Free Pascal Compilator** (FPC) (the `-MDelphi` switch should be active), which means the possibility of obtaining executable code for **XE/XL**, **PC** and every other platform for which **FPC** exists. **MP** is not a port of **FPC**; it has been written based on of **SUB-Pascal** (2009), **XD-Pascal** (2010), the author of which is [Vasiliy Tereshkov](mailto:vtereshkov@mail.ru).
